A project only code in C# where you are in a maze and the goal is to find the exit.

## Rules :

* You start at point s (start) and must arrive at point e (exit)
* The '*' kill you
* You move with the arrows of your keyboard
* Each time you pass somewhere, you condemn the cell and can't go back to it
* You can't go through walls, except if you step on the cell â˜» which will allow you to jump the walls only once
* if you get stuck, you will automatically lose.
